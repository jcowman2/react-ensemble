title: Installation
---

React Ensemble is hosted on [npm](https://npmjs.com) under the package name [react-ensemble](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-ensemble).

You can add it to your project from the command line with [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/):

```shell
yarn add react-ensemble
```

Or with [npm](https://npmjs.com):

```shell
npm i react-ensemble
```

## Compatibility with React

React Ensemble requires an installation of [react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) v16.8+. If you are starting a new React project with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/), your `package.json` dependencies should look something like this:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "react": "^16.13.1",
  "react-dom": "^16.13.1",
  "react-ensemble": "^1.0.0"
}
```

Otherwise, be sure to add the missing package:

```shell
yarn add react@latest
```
