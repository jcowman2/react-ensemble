React Ensemble is a library for building animations in [React](https://reactjs.org/). It's designed to help with longer animations that need to have precise timing or a lot of moving parts.

If you want to dive right in with some interactive examples, check out [Quick Start](/docs/quick-start). To learn what this library is all about, read on.

## Motivation

Once upon a time, I was working on a React project that needed to animate blocks of text in perfect sync with an audio track. While there were [several animation libraries](#alternatives-to-react-ensemble) out there already, none of them seemed to provide two key features I needed:

First, I needed **precise absolute timing**. Usually, we think of web animations as transitions with relative times. A UI element might _"fade in for 0.5 seconds"_ or _"rotate 180 degrees over 1 second."_ But since I was working with an audio track, I had to work in terms of absolute timestamps. My elements needed to _"fade in at 01:35.2 and fade out at 01:38.7."_

Second, I wanted to **keep my animation data and rendering logic separate**. A common way to script web animations is to tie smaller transitions to specific DOM elements. For example, a button may be scripted to shine when a user hovers over it. This method is great for gestures and aesthetics, but it isn't well suited to longer animations.

I needed a system that could take my data and my timestamps (essentially, my animation's _script_) and tell me what to render at any given moment. And so, React Ensemble was born!

## Main Features

React Ensemble is designed to provide the animator (that's you!) with three main abilities:

1. [Granular Control](#granular-control)
2. [Immediate Playback](#immediate-playback)
3. [Rendering Freedom](#rendering-freedom)

### Granular Control

### Immediate Playback

### Rendering Freedom

## Alternatives to React Ensemble

As an open source fan and contributor, I believe in choosing the right tool for the job and supporting other awesome projects. If React Ensemble isn't what you need, consider checking out these React animation libraries:

- [React Spring](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-spring): Spring physics-based
- [Framer Motion](https://github.com/framer/motion): Production-ready gesture support
- [React Motion](https://github.com/chenglou/react-motion): Minimalist spring animation
- [React Move](https://github.com/sghall/react-move): Data-driven animations
