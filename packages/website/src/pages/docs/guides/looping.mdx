title: Looping
---

You can configure some or all of your animation to repeat multiple times.

## Looping the Whole Track

To make the whole animation loop, set `endBehavior="loop"` in your `Timeline`.

## Boomerang

Boomerang is a special kind of loop: after your animation or region finishes, it will play backwards to its starting position before looping again.

To boomerang a whole animation, set `endBehavior="boomerang"` in your `Timeline`.

## Looping Regions

You can configure individual regions to loop or boomerang as well. Loop configuration is set via each track region's `loop` property.

To make a region loop a certain number of times, set `loop.count`

```js
{
  duration: 1000,
  state: { x: { to: 5 } },
  loop: {
    count: 2 // Will play three times: once like normal, then loop twice
  }
}
```

To make a region loop until a certain time, set `loop.until`

```js
{
  duration: 1000,
  state: { x: { to: 5 } },
  loop: {
    until: 2000 // Will loop until 2000 (for 1 second total)
  }
}
```

To make a region loop for a certain amount of time, set `loop.duration`

```js
{
  duration: 1000,
  state: { x: { to: 5 } },
  loop: {
    duration: 2000 // Will loop for 2 seconds (playing 2 additional times)
  }
}
```

To make a region boomerang, set `loop.boomerang`. This property can be used in combination with any other loop config.

```js
{
  duration: 1000,
  state: { x: { to: 5 } },
  loop: {
    boomerang: true,
    count: 2
  }
}
```

## Passive Loops

You may also set a track region's loop to `true`, rather than an object. If a track region's loop is `true` or `{ boomerang: true }`, then it is called a **passive loop**.

Passive loops do not have a defined end time. Rather, they run until something else stops them...or forever, if nothing does.

If there are any passive loops in a `Timeline` of which `endBehavior="continue"`, those passive loops will repeat indefinitely.
