title: Groups

Groups are a special kind of track region that are just a container for other regions.

Create a group by setting a region's `regions` property:

```js
const myGroup = {
  start: 1000,
  loop: true,
  regions: [
    { duration: 1000, state: { x: { to: 5 } } },
    { duration: 2000, state: { x: { to: 0 } } }
  ]
};
```

As you can see in the example, groups can have many of the same properties singular (or **atom**) track regions can have.
Specifically, track region groups share these properties with track region atoms:

- `start`
- `end`
- `easing`
- `interp`
- `layer`
- `loop`

A group may not have these properties, however:

- `state`
- `duration`

## Inheriting Properties

If `easing` or `interp` is set on a group, then that function will become the default `easing` or `interp` for every child of the group.
Just like normal, child regions may override their default easing and interpolation functions.

## Layer Namespaces

When animations are generated, React Ensemble treats groups essentially like self-contained animations.
Therefore, layers are handled a bit differently than they are in a single-dimensional track.

Child regions' layers are **namespaced** by their parent's layer name according to this pattern: `"parent-layer-name.layer-name"`.

```js
const track = [
  {
    layer: "top",
    regions: [
      { layer: "child", duration: 0 } // Will have layer = "top.child"
    ]
  }
];
```

For example, a region with the layer `"foo"` in a group will not be in the same layer as `"foo"` at the top level.

## Relative Time

Groups have an optional property `relativeTime` that sets whether or not child regions' timestamps will be considered relative to the group's start time.

Consider the following group:

```js
const myGroup = {
  start: 1000,
  regions: [
    { start: 2000, state: { x: { to: 5 } } },
    { duration: 1000, state: { x: { to: 0 } }, loop: { until: 5000 } }
  ]
};
```

There are two ways to interpret the `start` and `loop.until` properties of the group's children.

First, we can consider these times **absolute**. Every timestamp in a group with absolute timing is considered relative to the start of the _animation_.

```js
const myGroup = {
  start: 1000,
  relativeTime: false, // This is false by default, so including it is not needed
  regions: [
    { start: 2000, state: { x: { to: 5 } } }, // Start at 2 seconds (1 second after the group starts)
    { duration: 1000, state: { x: { to: 0 } }, loop: { until: 5000 } } // Loop until 5 seconds (4 seconds after the group starts)
  ]
};
```

Alternatively, we can consider these times **relative** to the start of the _group_.

```js
const myGroup = {
  start: 1000,
  relativeTime: true,
  regions: [
    { start: 2000, state: { x: { to: 5 } } }, // Start at 3 seconds (2 seconds after the group starts)
    { duration: 1000, state: { x: { to: 0 } }, loop: { until: 5000 } } // Loop until 6 seconds (5 seconds after the group starts)
  ]
};
```
