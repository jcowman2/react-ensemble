## Part 0: Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes you have enough React experience to be comfortable creating a React application, writing function components, and using a few common React Hooks (specifically, `useState`).

If that sounds like you, feel free to [skip to the next section](#part-1-setting-the-stage). Otherwise, read on!

### Using React

React Ensemble, as the name suggests, is a component library for React. If you're unfamiliar with React (or just need to brush up on the basics!), a good starting point is the [official React guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html).

You don't need to be a React expert by any means to read this guide, but it may be helpful to have experience with two key React features: **function components** and **the `useState` hook**.

All the examples in this guide use React function components, rather than class components. Instead of writing our React components like this:

```jsx
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const myState = this.state;
    // ...
  }
}
```

We'll be writing them as pure functions:

```jsx
const MyComponent = props => {
  const [myState, setMyState] = React.useState(defaultValue);
  // ...
};
```

If you're confused by that whole `React.useState` business, don't worry!
The `useState` function is part of the new Hooks feature in React, which lets us have state in functional components.

Here's a quick breakdown of our example:

- Calling `React.useState` returns a _value_ and a _setter_ for that specific piece of state.
- `myState` is the state's current value. By default, this will equal the `defaultValue` we passed in.
- `setMyState` is a callback function we can use when we want to update the state to a new value.

For more info on the `useState` hook, check out the [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html).

### Creating a New Project

You'll need a working React application to build the animation in this tutorial.
Because all the code will be in a single file, it doesn't really matter which environment you use.
You can try Create React App, an online playground, or your company's prod web app (not recommended).

[Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/) (CRA) is a super quick way to start a fully functional React app from the command line. To get started, run the following:

```shell
yarn create react-app my-animation
cd my-animation
yarn start
```

After a few minutes, you should see the CRA welcome page in your browser. Go ahead and delete the contents of `src/App.js`, and you're ready to go!

## Part 1: Setting the Stage

First, let's [install](/docs/installation) React Ensemble.

```shell
yarn add react-ensemble
```

**Note:** This guide uses JavaScript for clarity, but you can also follow along in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). For more information, see the guide on [using Typescript with React Ensemble](/docs/guides/using-typescript).

### The Container

Create a new file for our animation and add the following code:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { Timeline, Controller, Lib, TrackUtils } from "react-ensemble";

const MyAnimation = () => {
  return (
    <div
      style={{
        height: 150,
        width: "100%",
        position: "relative",
        display: "flex",
        justifyContent: "center"
      }}
    >
      Hi!
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyAnimation;
```

Here's what we did:

1. Imported `Timeline`, `Controller`, `Lib`, and `TrackUtils` from React Ensemble. Don't worry, we'll explain each of these as needed.
2. Created a component that returns a [flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) div. This div will contain our animation.

Running the code should render this:

```jsx live startHidden
() => {
  return (
    <div
      style={{
        height: 250,
        width: "100%",
        position: "relative",
        display: "flex",
        justifyContent: "center"
      }}
    >
      <div>Hi!</div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### The Circle

Next, we'll add the star of our show: a circle.

```jsx live renderOnly
() => {
  return (
    <div
      style={{
        height: 150,
        width: "100%",
        position: "relative",
        display: "flex",
        justifyContent: "center"
      }}
    >
      <div
        style={{
          position: "relative",
          borderRadius: 15,
          width: 30,
          height: 30,
          backgroundColor: "__primary",
          left: 0,
          top: 35,
          opacity: 1
        }}
      />
    </div>
  );
};
```

First, replace the `<div>Hi</div>` in our component with the following div:

```jsx
<div
  style={{
    position: "relative",
    borderRadius: 15,
    width: 30,
    height: 30,
    backgroundColor: "__primary",
    left: 0,
    top: 35,
    opacity: 1
  }}
/>
```

Giving us our perfect circle:

```jsx live startHidden
() => {
  return (
    <div
      style={{
        height: 250,
        width: "100%",
        position: "relative",
        display: "flex",
        justifyContent: "center"
      }}
    >
      <div
        style={{
          position: "relative",
          borderRadius: 15,
          width: 30,
          height: 30,
          backgroundColor: "__primary",
          left: 0,
          top: 35,
          opacity: 1
        }}
      />
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Part 2: Making Things Move

In this part, we'll breathe some life into our animation.

Start by adding the `Controller` and `Timeline` components we imported earlier into your JSX, right above the container from the last part.

```jsx
const MyAnimation = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <Controller>
        {props => <Timeline {...props} defaultState={{}} track={[]} />}
      </Controller>
      <div>{/* Animation Container */}</div>
    </>
  );
};
```

What do these components do? Here's a quick summary:

### Timeline

The `Timeline` component is the core engine behind our animation.
It takes our animation data as props (at a minimum, the animation's `track` and `defaultState`) and computes each frame in real time.

**Note:** `Timeline` doesn't render anything by itself. It simply returns data that we use to draw our animation.

### Controller

The `Controller` is an _optional_ component that automatically configures a `Timeline` and provides some basic UI controls for your animation.

You can animate using only the `Timeline` component if you want more control, but using a `Controller` is an easy way to get up and running right away.

### Default State

The prop `defaultState` is required by `Timeline`. It contains the starting state of your animation.

Outside your component, define your animation's default state:

```jsx
const defaultAnimState = {
  x: -250,
  opacity: 0
};
```

Then, pass your default state as a prop to your timeline:

```jsx
<Timeline {...props} defaultState={defaultAnimState} track={[]} />
```

### Drawing from Data

Next, we need to rewrite our circle from earlier to rely on our animation state. Create a `useState` hook in the component to track your animation state.

```jsx
const MyAnimation = () => {
  const [animState, setAnimState] = React.useState(defaultAnimState);
  // return ...
};
```

Remember, the `useState` syntax means that `animState` will always refer to the current state of our animation, starting with `defaultAnimState`.

Now, replace the `left` and `opacity` properties in the circle div to rely on the `x` and `opacity` properties of the animation state.

```jsx
<div
  style={{
    position: "relative",
    borderRadius: 15,
    width: 30,
    height: 30,
    backgroundColor: "__primary",
    left: animState.x, // Changed
    top: 35,
    opacity: animState.opacity // Changed
  }}
/>
```

If you look at the output of your app, you should see that the circle has disappeared. This means your animation is working! After all, you changed its opacity to zero and moved it 250px to the left.

### The Track

The final piece is the **track**, the `Timeline` prop that determines when and how our animation state changes.

A track is an array of objects called **regions**.
Each region contains a description of how certain state properties should change over a given time frame.

You can describe regions using these fields:

- `start`
- `stop`
- `duration`
- `state`
- `loop`
- [and more!](/docs/api/Timeline)

Lets animate our circle coming in and out of frame. Add the following code _outside_ the component:

```jsx
const track = [
  {
    duration: 1500,
    state: {
      opacity: { to: 1 },
      x: { to: 0 }
    }
  },
  {
    duration: 1500,
    state: {
      opacity: { to: 0 },
      x: { to: 250 }
    }
  }
];
```

Reading our track top-to-bottom, we can see that for the first 1.5 seconds (1500 ms), the circle's opacity will change to 1 and its x-coordinate will change to 0.
Over the next 1.5 seconds, the circle will fade back out and travel off the right side of the screen.

Finally, we'll make two additions to the timeline:

- Pass in the `track`.
- Hook up the Timeline's `onUpdate` callback to set our animation state on every frame.

```jsx
<Timeline
  {...props}
  defaultState={defaultAnimState}
  track={track}
  onUpdate={({ state }) => setAnimState(state)}
/>
```

On your live app, press play. _**It's alive!!**_

```jsx live startHidden
() => {
  ////////
  // Note: this block should be outside the component in your app
  const defaultAnimState = {
    x: -250,
    opacity: 0
  };

  const track = [
    {
      duration: 1500,
      state: {
        opacity: { to: 1 },
        x: { to: 0 }
      }
    },
    {
      duration: 1500,
      state: {
        opacity: { to: 0 },
        x: { to: 250 }
      }
    }
  ];
  // End block (the rest should be inside your component)
  ////////

  const [animState, setAnimState] = React.useState(defaultAnimState);

  return (
    <>
      <Controller>
        {props => (
          <Timeline
            {...props}
            defaultState={defaultAnimState}
            track={track}
            onUpdate={({ state }) => setAnimState(state)}
          />
        )}
      </Controller>
      <div
        style={{
          height: 250,
          width: "100%",
          position: "relative",
          display: "flex",
          justifyContent: "center"
        }}
      >
        <div
          style={{
            position: "relative",
            borderRadius: 15,
            width: 30,
            height: 30,
            backgroundColor: "__primary",
            left: animState.x,
            top: 35,
            opacity: animState.opacity
          }}
        />
      </div>
    </>
  );
};
```
