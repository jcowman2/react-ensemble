title: Controller API
---

The `Controller` component is an optional wrapper for the `Timeline` that automatically configures time and playback controls.

It can manage the `Timeline` invisibly (for instance, if you want your animation to play automatically), but the `Controller` also provides an animation playback UI that works without any configuration.
You can replace this playback control UI with custom elements as well.

## Import

```js
import { Controller } from "react-ensemble";
```

## Interface

`Controller` is a React component.

```ts
const Controller = <State extends object = any>(
  props: ControllerProps<State>
): JSX.Element | null;
```

## Props

- Type: `ControllerProps<State extends object = any>`
- The optional generic type parameter `State` refers to the structure of the animation's state. Must be an object.

Properties for the `Controller` component.

```ts
interface ControllerProps<State extends object = any> {
  children: (
    controlProps: Pick<
      TimelineProps<State>,
      "value" | "playing" | "playbackSpeed" | "onTick" | "onEnded" | "onLoad"
    >
  ) => JSX.Element;
  visible?: boolean;
  trigger?: "manual" | "auto";
  normalPlaybackSpeed?: number;
  fastForwardModifier?: number;
  reverseModifier?: number;
  panelStyle?: object;
  panel?: (props: ControlPanelProps) => JSX.Element;
}
```

### children

- Type: `(controlProps: Pick<TimelineProps<State>, ...>) => JSX.Element`
- **Required**

Provides a subset of configured [`TimelineProps`](/docs/api/timeline#props) that can be used to manage a `Timeline` automatically.

The configured props include:

- `value`
- `playing`
- `playbackSpeed`
- `onTick`
- `onEnded`
- `onLoad`

`Controller` will configure the value of these timeline properties based on its own props, including `trigger`, `normalPlaybackSpeed`, and `panel`.

This type of prop is called a **render prop** because the `Controller` uses it to know what to render. Use it by putting a function in between your `<Controller>` tags:

```jsx
<Controller>
  {props => (
    <Timeline {...props} track={myTrack} defaultState={myDefaultState} />
  )}
</Controller>
```

### visible

- Type: `boolean`
- Default: `true`

Whether the playback `panel` is visible.

### trigger

- Type: `"manual" | "auto"`
- Default: `"manual"`

Whether the configured `Timeline` should play automatically or wait for a manual trigger.

### normalPlaybackSpeed

- Type: `number`
- Default: `1`

The `playbackSpeed` to pass to the configured `Timeline` via the `children` render prop when the `panel` is in normal playback mode.

### fastForwardModifier

- Type: `number`
- Default: `2`

Is multiplied with `normalPlaybackSpeed` to calculate the `playbackSpeed` passed to the configured `Timeline` when the `panel` is in fast-forward playback mode.

### reverseModifier

- Type: `number`
- Default: `-2`

Is multiplied with `normalPlaybackSpeed` to calculate the `playbackSpeed` passed to the configured `Timeline` when the `panel` is in reverse playback mode.

### panelStyle

- Type: `object`
- Default: `{}`

The CSS style object passed to the `<div>` that contains the `panel`.

This prop is best suited for minor style adjustments. For more granular control over the panel's appearance, override the `panel` prop instead.

### panel

- Type: `(props: ControlPanelProps) => JSX.Element;`
- Default [`SimpleControlPanel`](/docs/api/simplecontrolpanel)

Renders a generic playback control panel for an animation based on props configured by `Controller` and its managed `Timeline`.

Provides all the data necessary to render a responsive playback control with play/pause, fast-forward, reverse, and progress bar features.
Includes both current information about the managed `Timeline` and a suite of callback functions to control it. See [`ControlPanelProps`](/docs/api/types#controlpanelprops).

Will render a basic, unstyled control panel by default intended for demo purposes. See [`SimpleControlPanel`](/docs/api/simplecontrolpanel).
