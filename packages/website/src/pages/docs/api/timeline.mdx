title: Timeline API
---

The `Timeline` component is the engine that builds an animation and calculates each frame's state in real time.

It manages an `Animation` instance generated with `TrackUtils.gen` and automatically queries frames based on its given time value.
`Timeline` may be configured to periodically update the time value via `setInterval`, or the time value may be controlled elsewhere.

## Import

```js
import { Timeline } from "react-ensemble";
```

## Interface

`Timeline` is a React component.

```ts
const Timeline: <State extends object = any>(
  props: React.PropsWithChildren<TimelineProps<State>>
) => null;
```

## Props

- Type: `TimelineProps<State extends object = any>`
- The optional generic type parameter `State` refers to the structure of the animation's state. Must be an object.

Properties for the `Timeline` component.

```ts
interface TimelineProps<State extends object = any> {
  track: TrackRegion<State>[];
  defaultState: State;
  value: number;
  playing: boolean;
  playbackSpeed?: number;
  interval?: number;
  endBehavior?: TimelineEndBehavior;
  easing?: EasingFunction;
  interp?: InterpolationFunction;
  resolver?: TrackLayerResolver<State>;
  onTick?: (event: TickEvent) => void;
  onUpdate?: (event: UpdateEvent<State>) => void;
  onEnded?: () => void;
  onLoad?: (event: LoadEvent<State>) => void;
}
```

### track

- Type: [`TrackRegion<State>[]`](/docs/api/types#trackregion)
- **Required**

The array of regions that make up the animation.

`track` is passed into `TrackUtils.gen()` immediately after `Timeline` mounts, calculating the `Animation`.
After `Timeline` initializes, it will not re-calculate the animation if `track` changes.

### defaultState

- Type: `State`
- **Required**

The animation's default state. Must be an object.

`defaultState` is passed into `TrackUtils.gen()` immediately after `Timeline` mounts, calculating the `Animation`.
After `Timeline` initializes, it will not re-calculate the animation if `defaultState` changes.

### value

- Type: `number`
- **Required**

The current frame of the animation, in milliseconds.

Changing this prop triggers a refresh within `Timeline` that queries the animation and returns the current frame state via `onUpdate` asynchronously.

### playing

- Type: `boolean`
- **Required**

Whether or not the animation is playing.

While true, the interval within `Timeline` will run (as specified by the `interval` prop) and trigger `onTick` callbacks.

### playbackSpeed

- Type: `number`
- Default: `1`

The timeline's playback speed multiplier.

`1` plays the animation at regular speed, `2` plays at double speed, `0.5` plays at half speed, etc.
Supply a negative number to play in reverse. For example, `-2` plays backwards at double speed.

### interval

- Type: `number`
- Default: `10`

The number of milliseconds the interval within `Timeline` will be set to, roughly corresponding to how often `onTick` callbacks will be triggered.

This property implies a performance versus quality tradeoff: larger intervals will refresh the frame less frequently,
causing choppier animations but using less resources, whereas smaller intervals will have smaller gaps between refreshes but a greater performance cost.

**This property is an approximation**, and will not match exactly with the values returned by `onTick`.
There are unavoidable (but minor) delays caused by querying the animation object and React renders, so expect less precision at the millisecond level.

### endBehavior

- Type: [`TimelineEndBehavior`](/docs/api/types#timelineendbehavior)
- Default: `"stop"`

Describes how the engine will calculate frame states for time values greater than the length of the animation.

### easing

- Type: [`EasingFunction`](/docs/api/types#easingfunction)
- Default: `undefined`

Sets the animation's default [easing function](/docs/guides/easing-and-interpolating#easing).

If not defined, [`TrackUtils.gen`](/docs/api/trackutils#gen) will use its own default easing function.

### interp

- Type: [`InterpolationFunction`](/docs/api/types#interpolationfunction)
- Default: `undefined`

Sets the animation's default [interpolation function](/docs/guides/easing-and-interpolating#interpolating).

If not defined, [`TrackUtils.gen`](/docs/api/trackutils#gen) will use its own default interpolation function.

### resolver

- Type: [`TrackLayerResolver<State>`](/docs/api/types#tracklayerresolver)
- Default: `undefined`

Sets the animation's default [layer resolver](/docs/guides/layers#layer-resolution).

If not defined, [`TrackUtils.gen`](/docs/api/trackutils#gen) will use its own default layer resolver.

### onTick

- Type: `(event: TickEvent) => void`
- Default: `() => {}`

If `playing` is true, this callback will fire approximately every `interval`.

`event.value` will be equal to the time value when the event was created.
See [`TickEvent`](/docs/api/types#tickevent).

Useful if a parent component is storing the animation's time value as state:

```jsx
onTick={({ value }) => setTick(value)}
```

### onUpdate

- Type: `(event: UpdateEvent<State>) => void`
- Default: `() => {}`

Will fire with the current frame state according to `value` whenever `value` changes.

See [`UpdateEvent`](/docs/api/types#updateevent).

Useful if a parent component is storing the animation's frame state:

```jsx
onUpdate={({ state }) => setAnimState(state)}
```

### onEnded

- Type: `() => void`
- Default: `() => {}`

Will fire when `value` is greater than or equal to the length of the track or when `value` is less than zero.

May trigger more than once.

### onLoad

- Type: `(event: LoadEvent<State>) => void`
- Default: `() => {}`

Will fire when `Timeline` initializes, returning the `Animation` calculated by `TrackUtils.gen()`.

See [`LoadEvent`](/docs/api/types#loadevent).

`Timeline` will initialize when it is mounted and whenever the following props change:

- `endBehavior`
- `easing`
- `interp`
- `resolver`
