title: SimpleControlPanel API
---

The `SimpleControlPanel` is a basic animation playback user interface.

It is intended for use in the `panel` property of the `Controller`, where it is rendered by default.
The `SimpleControlPanel` is unstyled; its purpose is to be an effortless demo component that can be replaced with a more aesthetically pleasing panel later.

## Import

```js
import { SimpleControlPanel } from "react-ensemble";
```

## Interface

`SimpleControlPanel` is a React component.

```ts
const SimpleControlPanel: React.FC<ControlPanelProps>;
```

## Props

- Type: [`ControlPanelProps`](/docs/api/types#controlpanelprops)

See [`ControlPanelProps`](/docs/api/types#controlpanelprops).

## Playground

```jsx live startHidden
() => {
  const [tick, setTick] = React.useState(0);
  const [playing, setPlaying] = React.useState(false);
  const [direction, setDirection] = React.useState(Direction.Normal);

  // Note: You most likely wouldn't ever render SimpleControlPanel
  // directly like this. Controller manages all these props in a
  // similar way when you use SimpleControlPanel as its panel prop.
  // See the Controller API docs for more information.
  return (
    <SimpleControlPanel
      tick={tick}
      length={1000}
      playing={playing}
      direction={direction}
      setTick={t => setTick(t)}
      play={() => setPlaying(true)}
      pause={() => setPlaying(false)}
      fastForward={() =>
        setDirection(prev =>
          prev === Direction.FastForward
            ? Direction.Normal
            : Direction.FastForward
        )
      }
      reverse={() =>
        setDirection(prev =>
          prev === Direction.Reverse ? Direction.Normal : Direction.Reverse
        )
      }
    />
  );
};
```
