title: Type Definitions API
---

React Ensemble is written in TypeScript.
Although you can use the library freely with JavaScript, the structure of your application's inputs will be expected to match certain types.
Therefore, referencing the type definitions can be useful even for JavaScript developers.

The type definitions in this file are considered part of React Ensemble's public API.

## Animation

## ControlPanelProps

Includes all the data necessary to render a responsive playback control with play/pause, fast-forward, reverse, and progress bar features.

```ts
interface ControlPanelProps {
  tick: number;
  length: number | null;
  playing: boolean;
  direction: Direction;
  setTick: (tick: number) => void;
  play: () => void;
  pause: () => void;
  fastForward: () => void;
  reverse: () => void;
}
```

| Property    | Type                      | Description                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| tick        | `number`                  | The track's time position (in milliseconds).                 |
| length      | `number` or `null`        | The length of the animation (in milliseconds).               |
| playing     | `boolean`                 | Whether the animation is playing.                            |
| direction   | [`Direction`](#direction) | The mode of playback.                                        |
| setTick     | `(tick: number) => void`  | Callback to signal a manual tick change.                     |
| play        | `() => void`              | Callback to signal a manual play.                            |
| pause       | `() => void`              | Callback to signal a manual pause.                           |
| fastForward | `() => void`              | Callback to signal a manual fast-forward toggle (on or off). |
| reverse     | `() => void`              | Callback to signal a manual reverse toggle (on or off).      |

Used primarily by `Controller` to communicate with its `panel` prop, which is `SimpleControlPanel` by default.

## Direction

Enumeration of all possible playback modes in a `Controller`.

```ts
enum Direction {
  Normal,
  FastForward,
  Reverse
}
```

| Value                   | Description                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Direction.Normal`      | The animation is playing forwards at normal speed.                                                             |
| `Direction.FastForward` | The animation is playing forwards at a faster speed. The exact rate is configured by `Controller`.             |
| `Direction.Reverse`     | The animation is playing backwards, sometimes at a faster speed. The exact rate is configured by `Controller`. |

## EasingFunction

## InterpolationFunction

## LoadEvent

Event payload returned by `Timeline` when it finishes initializing the animation.

```ts
interface LoadEvent<State extends object = any> {
  animation: Animation<State>;
}
```

| Property  | Type                             | Description              |
| --------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| animation | [`Animation<State>`](#animation) | The generated animation. |

## TickEvent

Event payload returned by `Timeline` on each tick.

```ts
interface TickEvent {
  value: number;
}
```

| Property | Type     | Description                                  |
| -------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| value    | `number` | The track's time position (in milliseconds). |

## TimelineEndBehavior

Describes how the engine will calculate frame states for time values greater than the length of the animation.

```ts
type TimelineEndBehavior = "stop" | "continue" | "loop" | "boomerang";
```

| Value         | Description                                                                                                             |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `"stop"`      | Time will be clamped to the length of the animation. Gives the impression of the animation pausing once it is finished. |
| `"continue"`  | Time will continue to increase. Passive loops will continue to run indefinitely.                                        |
| `"loop"`      | Time will reset back to the start of the animation. Gives the impression of the animation looping.                      |
| `"boomerang"` | Time will be transformed so the animation appears to run backwards after it completes, then start over.                 |

## TrackConfig

## TrackLayerResolver

## TrackRegion

## TrackRegionAtom

## TrackRegionGroup

## UpdateEvent

Event payload returned by `Timeline` every time its time value updates.

```ts
interface UpdateEvent<State extends object = any> {
  state: State;
}
```

| Property | Type    | Description                                                      |
| -------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| state    | `State` | The animation's frame state at the time the event was generated. |
